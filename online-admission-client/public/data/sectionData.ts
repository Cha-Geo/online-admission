However, in 1983, after producing three sets of students, the College temporarily closed its doors. In 1981, the leadership initiated a part-time program for the campus community named Short Term Ministerial Course (STMC) to reach the elite of society. It temporarily suspended these programs in 1983. Ghana also participated in training its ministers and leaders by sending students to Lagos for these programs before their eventual suspension."

      "In 1992-94 and 1997-2000, Ghana initiated its DL-IBTC programs at Pakyi No. 2, Kumasi, and Accra, respectively. Another program began in 2004 and continues to date, thanks to an idea from the former National Overseer, Pastor Israel Akinsola. In 2003, an IBTC Implementation Committee was formed to establish formal parameters for IBTC's rebirth. This committee worked diligently, leading to IBTC's revival. The first batch of students was oriented in Kumasi in November 2004, and the college opened in Kumasi as the sole campus in Ghana with 57 pioneering students."

The University College is also accredited by the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) to run a 2-year Diploma in Theology Program.
